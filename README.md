The documentation is in my native language, so you will need to translate it yourself in english.
This was the final prototipe:

Also the number for the ir senzor needs to be modify for your needs.( for a brighter room, the ir senzor will modify the values and be aware that, because it's working based on light, it can confuse bright light with fire)
The video that i used to build the prototipe:

The ultrasound doesnt apear in the video, but is not hard to add.
